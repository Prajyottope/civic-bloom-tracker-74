## Slide 2: Proposed Solution

**IDEA TITLE:** Clean & Green Technology

**PROBLEM ADDRESSED:**
Citizens face difficulties reporting civic issues like potholes, waste management problems, and infrastructure damage. Municipal authorities lack efficient systems to track and resolve these issues.

**PROPOSED SOLUTION:**
• Comprehensive web-based platform for civic issue reporting and management
• Dual interface: Citizen portal for reporting issues + Municipal dashboard for management
• Real-time tracking system from report to resolution
• Location-based issue filtering and management
• Photo documentation for better assessment
• Priority-based issue categorization
• Automated notification system for status updates

**INNOVATION & UNIQUENESS:**
• Seamless integration between citizen and municipal workflows
• Smart location-based filtering with tier-1 city prioritization
• Real-time dashboard with comprehensive analytics
• Multi-modal authentication system for different user types

## Slide 3: Technical Approach

**TECHNOLOGIES USED:**
• **Frontend:** React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
• **Backend:** Supabase (PostgreSQL database, Authentication, Real-time subscriptions)
• **Deployment:** Vite build system, Modern web hosting platforms
• **UI/UX:** Shadcn/UI component library, Responsive design
• **Security:** Row Level Security (RLS), JWT authentication

**METHODOLOGY & IMPLEMENTATION:**

**CITIZEN WORKFLOW:**
1. User Registration/Login → Issue Reporting → Photo Upload → Location Selection → Submit
2. Real-time status tracking → Notifications → Issue resolution confirmation

**MUNICIPAL WORKFLOW:**
1. Municipal Team Login → Dashboard Overview → Issue Assignment → Status Updates
2. Priority Management → Analytics & Reporting → Citizen Communication

**ARCHITECTURE:**
```
Citizen Interface ↔ Supabase Database ↔ Municipal Dashboard
     ↓                       ↓                    ↓
Real-time Updates    Secure Data Storage    Analytics Engine
